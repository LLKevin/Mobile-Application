# Mobile-Application

This is an application created using JQuery,
JQuery Mobile, Javascript, HTML, and CSS for Mobile devices.

The application is functions similar to how a shopping cart would function without a backend.
The functions include are: 

''' Add an item to the store listing
''' Specify the amout of a particular item and add it to the cart
''' Allow cart item quanity to be updated
''' Allow cart item to be removed
''' Empty the shopping cart
''' Checkout the shopping cart.This will redirect to a form to enter shipping details.
''' Display the cart items and shipping information as a receipt. 

I create databases to hold some of the information (Web SQL) and additional data is temporary saved to local storage.
This application will include a APK which allow installation on Android smart phones.
